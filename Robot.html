<h1>Our research</h1>
<div class="research-container">
On our research we worked very hard and talked to many people that helped us.
Guy Mechraz, Elazar Falik, Ron Porat, and Liat Gidron Heineman.
Guy Mechraz is now developing the etheylene* sensor we would like to use in our project, Elazar Falik invited us to volkani institute to see how they take care of fruits and vegetables using quarantine*, Ron Porat taught us about quarantine and its pros and cons and accepted our idea that etheylene* is the gas that is right to search for and intoduced us to Guy Mechraz, wich we talked about earlier.
Liat Gidron Heineman introduced us to the problem and invited us to the port she is working at where we heard from people that our solution will be very helpful and they are thirsty for it.

<h1>Our robot</h1>
<div class="robot-container">
Our robot is as compact as possible.
We built it so he would be able to use a motor to make the "arms" we built move, the robot has a facing up motor to power the "arms", two more motors to make the wheels drive and a gyro sensor, wich can tell us the direction the robot is facing and a color sensor to follow the black lines on the game board.
In the front of the robot there is a place to easily insert the arms and make them stable.
Our robot's name is Quack Dastley.
